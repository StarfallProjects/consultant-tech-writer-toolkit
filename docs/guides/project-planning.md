# Project planning

This page covers both planning when considering a new client or project, such as identifying project scope, and new client onboarding once you've agreed to work together.

## Consider before taking on a project

## Consider after taking on a project

### Who do I report to?

#### Example
"I am working as part of the engineering team, reporting to the lead developer."

### Who are the key stakeholders in this project?

#### Example
"My goal is to reduce support load, so I should work closely with the support team."

### Who are my reviewers?

#### Example
"I am documenting a complex API. I need the developers to review my work for technical accuracy."

### What tools do I need access to?

#### Example
"This client uses GitHub to manage their docs, and Netlify to deploy them. I need adding to the client's teams and access to their repos."
