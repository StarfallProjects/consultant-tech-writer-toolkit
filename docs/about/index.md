The following people took part in the Consultant Toolkit writing day project at [Write the Docs Vilnius 2019](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/vilnius/2019/). This session generated a lot of the material for the **Consider** section on the [guides](../guides/index.md) pages, tips for [finding work](../resources/find-work.md), and helped focus and direct this site.
