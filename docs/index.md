## Purpose

Consultant and freelance tech writers often end up working alone. They create documents and tools to help their work, including contracts, workflows, email templates and more. This site is intended as a place to collate these resources, bringing together the tools and experience of a diverse range of consultants. The templates in the [toolkit](kit/index.md) section are a good starting point for new freelancers. [Resources](resources/index.md) provides collections of documents, grouped by purpose. Browse at will.
