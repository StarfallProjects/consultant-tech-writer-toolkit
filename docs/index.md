# Tech writer toolkit

Resources for technical writers.

## Origin and purpose

Consultant and freelance tech writers often work alone. They create documents and tools to help their work, including contracts, workflows, email templates and more. This site started as a place to collate these resources, bringing together the tools and experience of a diverse range of consultants. 

## Site contents

[Consulting and freelancing](consultant/introduction.md) is the consultant's guide. It includes guidance on creating a business identity, templates to support project management and admin, and more. It was largely produced during the writing day at Write the Docs Vilnius 2019.

[Links and resources](resources/introduction.md) provides currated collections of links.

Refer to [About](about.md) for information about the contributors to this site. The [GitHub README](https://github.com/StarfallProjects/tech-writer-toolkit) provides details on how to add content or suggestions.
