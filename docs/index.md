## Purpose

Consultant and freelance tech writers often work alone. They create documents and tools to help their work, including contracts, workflows, email templates and more. This site is intended as a place to collate these resources, bringing together the tools and experience of a diverse range of consultants. 

The [guides](guides/index.md) section is a good starting point for new freelancers and professionals who are refocusing their career. It provides key points to think about when creating your own documents and planning your freelance career, and templates to get started with.

[Resources](resources/index.md) provides collections of documents, grouped by purpose. Browse at will.

Refer to [about](about/index.md) for information about the contributors to this site. The [GitHub README](https://github.com/StarfallProjects/consultant-tech-writer-toolkit) provides details on how to add content or suggestions.
