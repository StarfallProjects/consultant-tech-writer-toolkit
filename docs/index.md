# Tech Writer Toolkit

## Purpose

Consultant and freelance tech writers often work alone. They create documents and tools to help their work, including contracts, workflows, email templates and more. This site started as a place to collate these resources, bringing together the tools and experience of a diverse range of consultants. 



[Resources](resources/introduction.md) provides currated collections of links.

Refer to [about](about.md) for information about the contributors to this site. The [GitHub README](https://github.com/StarfallProjects/consultant-tech-writer-toolkit) provides details on how to add content or suggestions.
