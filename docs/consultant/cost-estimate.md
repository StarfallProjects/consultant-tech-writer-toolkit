# Cost estimate

Provide a cost estimate to potential clients, based on the costs and rates considered in your [business plan](business-plan.md).

## Consider

### Do I want to charge hourly, or per job?

#### Example
"I prefer flexibility and want to ensure I get paid for exactly what I do. I'll charge an hourly rate."

### How will I estimate my hours for a job?

#### Example
"I will use time trackers to learn how fast I work, so I can quote an accurate rate per job."
