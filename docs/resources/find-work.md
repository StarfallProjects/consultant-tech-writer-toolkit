# Finding work

## Communities and networking

* Join online technical writer communities such as [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/), or the communities around your tools. Be active in these communities: contribute to discussions, answer questions, attend conferences.
* Attend local events and make contacts. Try searching for events on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) and [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/).

## Qualifications and certifications

Before pursuing qualifications, consider whether employers will value them. Choose institutions and certifications that are respected by your target clients.  

## Freelancer websites

Look at sites like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/). You may find you need to hunt actively for work initially, but over time clients start approaching you. It helps to have a specialized profile: this makes it easier for potential clients to identify you, increases client confidence, and allows you to increase your rates.
